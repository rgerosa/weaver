# Prodouce a docker image with weaver

* First step is install weaver locally following the recipe given in the main README file at [Weaver Installation][https://github.com/hqucms/weaver#readme] with only one differnce: don't install torch in this step since its installation will be performed directly in the ``Docker`` procedure. If you add root to the conda installation, about 10 Gb of total space are needed.

* Once installed ``Weaver`` within a conda environment, dependent packages can be exported via:

```sh
conda activate weaver
conda env export > weaver-environment.yaml
conda deactivate
```			

* The Docker image is created by describing the installation procedure in the ``Docker`` file. A ``.dockerignore`` file can be used express caches/packages not to be included in the docker container. 

* By default the docker images and corresponding containers are created on the local machine file system in ``/var/lib/docker/``. Therefore, you need to create the container on a machine for which you have ``root`` priviledges and enough space to host a container with a total size of about 8-15 Gb depending on how many conda/pip packages you want to include.

* The ``Docker`` file is contained in this directory. To create the container and then execute it locally:

```sh
# Build container
sudo docker build -t <name of the container> .
# Display images and containes
sudo docker images
sudo docker containers
# Run container locally
sudo docker -i -t <name of the container> /bin/bash
```

* It is commonly good practise to store ``Docker`` images in github/gitlab repositories if your account has enough space. In this case you can upload to gitlab and then reclaim space on the local machine as follows:

```sh
sudo docker login <git repository>
sudo docker push <git repository/account name/name of the container>
sudo docker system prune --all --force
```
